            <h1>Harry Potter And the Goblet of Fire</h1>
            <p>
                Harry Potter has a nightmare in which a Muggle caretaker 
                named Frank Bryce is murdered at the Riddle House after overhearing 
                a plot by Lord Voldemort, Peter Pettigrew and another man whom 
                Harry does not recognise. The following morning, Harry attends 
                the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasleys,
                 Hermione Granger, Cedric Diggory and his father Amos.
                 Harry informs Dumbledore of Cedric's murder and Voldemort's return. Harry is escorted by Moody to his office where he learns that Moody put his name into the Goblet and was guiding him.
